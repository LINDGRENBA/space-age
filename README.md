# Space Age

#### A test driven development and behavior driven development project for Epicodus, 06.26.2020

## By Brittany Lindgren

## Description

Now you can find out how old you would be if you lived on Mars, Jupiter or Mercury! Use this nifty application to calculate your age on other planets.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

| Steps | Example |
| -------- | ----- |
| Follow this [link to the project repository](https://github.com/LINDGRENBA/space-age) on GitHub.   |  [Link to the project repository](https://github.com/LINDGRENBA/space-age)  |    
| Click on the "Clone or download" button to copy the project link.   |   ![Image of GitHub Clone or download button](img/readme/clone-download-button.PNG)   |   
| If you are comfortable with the command line, you can copy the project link and clone it through your command line with the command `git clone`. Otherwise, I recommend choosing "**Download ZIP**".   |   ![Download ZIP option on GitHub](img/readme/download-zip.PNG)  |   
|  Once the ZIP file has finished downloading, you can right click on the file to view the zip folder in your downloads.   |   ![ZIP folder in downloads](img/readme/zip-folder.PNG)  |   
| Right click on the project ZIP folder that you have just downloaded and choose the option "**Copy To...**", then choose the location where you would like to save this folder.    |   ![Saving ZIP to new location with 'Copy To'](img/readme/copy-to.PNG)  |   
| Navigate to the final location where you have chosen to save the project folder.   |    |   
| To view the code itself, right click, choose "open with..." and open using a text editor such as VS Code or Atom, etc.   |     |
|  Once you have cloned or downloaded the project and opened it in VS Code or another text editor, open a new terminal by navigating to Terminal -> New Terminal. A terminal will open on the page.  | ![Opening a terminal in VS Code](img/readme/terminal.PNG)  |
| In the terminal type the command `npm install` to install node modules. You should see a file called node_modules appear  |  ![running npm install](img/readme/npm-install.PNG)  |
| You can now view the project in your browser by typing the command `npm run start` in the terminal  | `npm run start` |
